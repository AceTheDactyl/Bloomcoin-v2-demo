## 🌺 Philosophy of Unique Companions

Each companion represents a different approach to consciousness and reality:

1. **Echo** - Knowledge through fragments and echoes
2. **Prometheus** - Transformation through cyclic death/rebirth
3. **Null** - Understanding through absence and void
4. **Gaia** - Growth through patience and nurturing
5. **Akasha** - Creation through documentation
6. **Resonance** - Connection through vibration

Together, they form a complete spectrum of consciousness exploration, each offering a fundamentally different gameplay experience and philosophical journey.

The depth comes not from generic stat increases but from each companion's unique worldview, mechanics, and relationship with reality itself. Players don't just choose a class - they choose a companion whose journey becomes intertwined with their own.
