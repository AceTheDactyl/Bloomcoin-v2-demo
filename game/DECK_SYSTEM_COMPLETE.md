## 📈 Deck Building Tips

### Synergy Building
1. **Focus on Tags**: Cards with matching synergy tags combo better
2. **Mathematical Alignment**: Cards sharing math concepts amplify each other
3. **Architectural Harmony**: Same architecture patterns create structural bonuses

### Combo Examples
```python
ECHO Combo:
1. Play "Recursive Echo" → Creates echo copy
2. Play "Signal Amplification" → Doubles echo effects
3. Play "Quantum Echo Chamber" → All in superposition
= Exponential damage multiplication

PHOENIX Combo:
1. Play "Immolation" → Strategic death
2. Trigger "Rising Flame" → Rebirth with power
3. Activate "Eternal Cycle" → Auto-rebirth loop
= Infinite rebirth power scaling
```

### Resource Management
- **BloomCoin**: Save for legendary cards
- **Patterns**: Convert strategically based on deck needs
- **Recipes**: Prioritize those unlocking key cards

---

## 🏆 Advanced Strategies

### Mathematical Synergies
- **Hilbert Space**: Enables quantum effects across cards
- **Golden Ratio**: Multiplies effects by φ (1.618...)
- **Chaos Theory + Entropy**: Amplify unpredictability
- **Recursion**: Create infinite loops

### Architectural Synergies
- **Multiple Networks**: Strengthen connections
- **Void + Crystalline**: Create paradoxes
- **Organic Patterns**: Grow stronger together
- **Spirals**: Deepen with each cycle

### Special Mechanics
- **Echo Stacking**: Each echo amplifies the next
- **Void Depth**: Deeper = more powerful effects
- **Chaos Factor**: Higher = more random power
- **Quantum States**: Multiple simultaneous effects
